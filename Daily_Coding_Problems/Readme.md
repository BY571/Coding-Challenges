#### Challenge -1- list manipulation 25.2.2019
##### Task: 
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is
the producht of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example: if our input was [1,2,3,4,5], the expected output would be: [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].
    or: [3,2,1] -> [2,3,6]

#### Challenge -2- find lowest missing integer 1.3.2019
##### Task: Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. 
In other words, find the lowest positiv integer that does not exist in the array. 
The array can obtain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
For example, the input [3,4,-1,1] sould give 2. The input [1,2,0] should give 3. 
And so on...
